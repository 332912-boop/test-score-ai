# test-score-ai# Test Score Prediction AI

## Problem
Students often wonder how their study habits and sleep affect their test performance. 
This project explores whether a computer can predict a test score based on hours studied and hours slept.

## Solution
I created a simple machine learning model that learns from past student data.
The model looks at how many hours a student studied and slept, then predicts a possible test score using linear regression.

## Tools
- Python  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- Google Sheets (for creating training data)

## Results
The trained AI model successfully generated a predicted test score for a student who studied 6 hours and slept 8 hours.
The output is displayed directly in the program and saved in a text file.

## Learning
I learned how machine learning models are trained using real data and how Python libraries can be used to build simple AI projects.
